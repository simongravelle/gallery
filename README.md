### How it is done ###

Most figure are generated using [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/),
from molecular dynamics simulations done with [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) using topology
from the [atb](https://atb.uq.edu.au/).

### About me ###

I am a computer physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces. You can 
find more information on my [personal webpage](https://simongravelle.github.io/).
